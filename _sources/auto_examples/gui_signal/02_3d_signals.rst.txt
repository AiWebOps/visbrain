Plot a 3D array of data
=======================

Plot and inspect a 3D array of data.

This example is an extension to the previous one (01_2d_signals.py). This time,
instead of automatically re-organizing the 2D grid, the program use the number
of channels for the number of rows in the grid and the number of trials for the
number of columns.
To illustrate this point, we generate a random EEG dataset composed with 20
channels, 10 trials of 4000 points each. The 2D grid will have a shape of
(20 rows, 10 columns).
