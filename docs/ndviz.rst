The Ndviz module groups a bundle of functionalities for the visualization of mutli-dimentional data. It can be used to represent all of your signals in a single canvas (see this `example <https://github.com/vispy/vispy/blob/master/examples/demo/gloo/realtime_signals.py>`_ by `Cyrille Rossant <https://github.com/rossant>`_ for the original script). Each single signal can then be plot as a traditional continious line, a cloud of points, a histogram, a spectrogram or as an image.
